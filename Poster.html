Poster Guidelines and Rules

New in 2020, teams will create an interactive poster using their assigned poster wiki page. This page will be the only wiki page you can edit after the Wiki Freeze. Below are some guidelines and rules for this new type of poster.

Guidelines

* Posters should be a visual abstract and clear, concise summary of your project.
* Your poster page should not be an endlessly scrolling page, packed with small-font text, etc.
* Posters are not meant to be landing pages to link to more information about your project. A poster is meant to stand alone.
* The use of links is discouraged. Judges will not be clicking on links on your poster page during their evaluation.
* Teams should divide the poster into sections on the page to break up the information into easy-to-read and easy-to-find sections.
* Posters can contain up to three (3) short animated images (5-10 sec in length; gif format preferred) to highlight a specific part of your project. These animated images should be minor elements and be used to help explain complex ideas or results.

Rules

* No videos are allowed on the Team Poster page. Videos were done for the Project Promotion Video and Team Presentation Video, and you can post other videos on your Team Wiki pages.
* All content must be hosted on the iGEM servers.
* All images and files used for the poster must be exclusively uploaded for the poster. If you want to show the same image on one of your Wiki pages and on the Poster, then you need to upload the same image twice.
* You cannot use the same URL for an image or file on your Team Wiki and your Team Poster.
* For uploading images and files for your poster, you must use the following naming convention: T--[TeamName]--Poster_[Section].file extension. These uploaded images and files can only be posted on the poster page.

The expectations for viewing the content will be in a standard web browser on a 13-inch computer screen (1280*800 pixels) set at 100% zoom in the browser.

<p>In Asia, many old people suffer from insufficient calcium intake and related diseases such as osteoporosis. Considering that traditional calcium supplementation is not efficient and user-friendly enough, we intended to develop a kind of engineered bacteria based on <i>E. coli</i> that can colonize in the human intestine and secrete peptides to promote calcium absorption.</p>
<p>We introduced the quorum sensing system to colonize bacteria in the intestine. Once the bacteria have successfully colonized the intestinal tract, the luxPR promoter will be activated and a series of short peptides that can bind to calcium and promote calcium absorption of intestinal epithelial cells will be expressed. A kill switch is added accordingly for safety.</p>
<p>Our project provides a novel delivery method to provide calcium supplements sustainably. And we are actively seeking commercialization possibilities to expand our project impact, to reach more population, for the elderly's good health and well-being.</p>

            <div class="title"> @@@@ What we have achieved </div>
            <div class="text">
<h4>Where we came from</h4>
<p>A large portion of the elderly Asian population suffers from insufficient calcium intake and related diseases like osteoporosis. Experts recommend that osteoporosis prevention should begin as early as middle age.</p>
<p>Curious about how calcium deficiency affects the elderly and the middle-aged, we conducted a survey to learn whether/how we are able to help with calcium supplementation. Our overall results indicate that the younger generation has a strong awareness of bone health and has taken action to supplement their calcium intake.<br/>
<img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/1/1d/T--Fudan--Poster_survey.png" alt="informgram survey" /><br/>
More than half of our respondents aged between 40 and 60 replied that they know more than 3 seniors with fractures from falls. We realized that health issues surrounding bone health are no longer figures on paper but tangible challenges in many families. <span class="bgMenu">Calcium deficiency is clearly an urgent issue that requires immediate change.</span> But, the current calcium supplementation approaches are inefficient and not user-friendly, particularly towards the elderly. In early 2020, we initiated <i>Bone Appetit</i>, a project that strives to build efficient, user-friendly and sustainable calcium supplementation for the elderly.</p>
<h4>Where we are now</h4>
<p>In the past 10 months, we combined work of lab, production, entrepreneurship, education and safety. We developed a thorough proof of our concept involving modeling a kill switch, designing and testing secretion peptides guided calcium absorption peptide (<span class="span_click" onclick="

<p>Our overall engineering success could not be achieved without the help of modeling and learning from the experienced. We modeled the initiation and steady states of a quorum sensing system.<br/>

We consulted various experts to improve our project. We <a href="/Team:Fudan/Collaborations" target="_blank">collaborated</a> with BNU-China when designing our Kill Switch.</p>
<p>
@@@@
We believe that developing basic parts and composite parts is an area that we shine. We developed a novel peptide that binds to calcium ion (CaAp), demonstrated that OmpA-CaAP has the best secretion, and Ni-NTA could be used to enrich CaAP via its 6x-His tag. Fourteen different promoters drive CaAP expression are available for future examination and much more.

</p>
<p>To conduct quality education to the elderly, we started educating the young and instruct them to educate their parents and/or grandparents. We formed <a href="/Team:Fudan/Partnership" target="_blank">partnerships</a> with other iGEM teams to better educate the young and those from the rural areas. We actively reached out to high school students, undergraduates and all age groups with accessible educational opportunities.</p>
<h4>Our contributions to #iGEM</h4>
<p>To conclude, our team has contributed to the iGEM community in various aspects, from <a href="/Team:Fudan/Inclusion" target="_blank">inclusive</a> <a href="/Team:Fudan/Education" target="_blank">education</a> to contributing <a href="http://parts.igem.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2020&group=Fudan" target="_blank">new parts to the Registry</a>, from <a href="/Team:Fudan/Model" target="_blank">improved modeling</a> to <a href="/Team:Fudan/Measurement" target="_blank">a novel measurement</a> and <a href="/Team:Fudan/Entrepreneurship" target="_blank">a business plan</a>. We hope that our project is not just limited to providing <span class="bgMenu">solid foundations for future research</span> to build upon, but also contributes to achieving <a class="bgMenu" href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank">the sustainable development goals</a> outlined by the United Nations.</p>

<p>Our project aims to provide a holistic solution to the problem of osteoporosis among seniors. Our online general biology course <i>Shengyin</i> and senior-friendly textbooks, were designed to educate the elderly on the importance of bone health.<br/>

</p>

<p>Since post-menopausal women are more likely to suffer osteoporosis, we paid special attention to them. Chinese women favor traditional art crosstalk, and we combined interesting art with basic synthetic biology knowledge. When we went to the nursing house to visit the elderly, we performed it for them, and they all laughed and enjoyed our performance very much.</p>

<p>Another thing we did is to promote a traditional Chinese sport - Mu'lan'quan to them. Many older women liked the sport because it is both elegant and healthy. The movements of Mu'lan'quan combine dancing and Kungfu and is preferred by many females. It is convenient to practice it - anybody can do it with a fan. We hoped our effect could help the elderly women to strengthen their health and prevent osteoporosis.<br/>

<p>With the rapid development of technology and society, the older generation is gradually lagging behind. The elderly is facing fraud, misinformation, and diseases. Lifelong education has become an urgent need for them. We dedicated ourselves to exploring education approaches, trying to bring high-quality education for the elderly and protect them from fraud and misinformation.</p>

<p>We used a previous unexplored education approach to educate the elderly - educating the younger generation and instructing them how to educate their grandparents. Compared with traditional education strategies, our approach offers emotional support from the younger generation and is comfortable for the elderly. In countries like Japan, Korea, Singapore, and China, where the bond between grandparents and grandkids is incredibly tight, our approach is undoubtedly effective.<br/>

<p>To educate the youth, we have held online summer camps for high school students to pass on aged care, in addition to synthetic biology which we have been teaching in the past several years. We developed an online audio course on basic biology knowledge, which could be listened to by both the youth and the elderly.</p>

<p>Our free online audio course <i>The Voice Of Biology</i> runs on multiple popular platforms with easy access to all age groups. We incorporated graphics to attract younger audiences and provided large font textbooks to accommodate seniors and those with hearing impairment. 上传两个ogg格式的音频文件</p>

<br/>According to literature, we selected peptides GPAGP<span class="bgMenu">H</span>GPVG, F<span class="bgMenu">D</span>HIVY, YQ<span class="bgMenu">E</span>PVIAPKL, N<span class="bgMenu">DEE</span>LNK, <span class="bgMenu">DH</span>TK<span class="bgMenu">E</span>. All of these peptides can form calcium-peptide complex through their Asp, Glu and His residues, and facilitate uptake by cells. We linked these peptides through Phe-Arg (FR) junctions. When CaAP is released into the intestinal lumen, CaAP could be further cleaved into functional oligopeptides in the presence of digestive enzymes (trypsin and chymotrypsin). We contributed a basic part <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3606000" target="_blank">BBa_K3606000</a> to the Registry, which is RFC10 assembly compatible.</p>

<p>We added a signal peptide to the N terminus of CaAP to guide its secretion into the periplasmic space of <i>E. coli</i>. Because it is so small, it will then leak out of the cell wall into the outside environment (intestinal lumen). There are 2 existing prokaryotic signal peptides (<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K208004" target="_blank">PelB</a>, <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K808028" target="_blank">PhoA</a>) in the Registry, and we contributed 3 more (<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3606042" target="_blank">NSP4</a>, <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3606043" target="_blank">OmpA</a>, <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3606030" target="_blank">DsbA</a>).</p>

<p>Driven by a quorum sensing promoter, <i>E. coli</i> only express signal peptide linked CaAP after their colonization. We demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> released CaAP by SDS-PAGE, in trichloroacetic acid precipitated bacterial culture media samples.<br/>

<p>McbA,B,C,D jointly complete the secretion of MccB17. Among them, peptide product from <i>mcbA</i> is the precursor of the antimicrobial peptide, and McbB,C,D is responsible for the post-translational modification of McbA, to produce MccB17. McbE,F assemble the channel to export MccB17. McbG provides the immunity against MccB17. If the engineered bacteria express only McbA,B,C,D, but neither McbE,F nor McbG, intracellular accumulated MccB17 will kill itself. When the surrounding bacteria absorb MccB17 but not McbG, they would die.</p>

<p>We place <i>mcbABCD</i> under the control of a constitutive promoter, and use PtetR drive the expression of McbEFG. After the density of engineered bacteria increases to a certain extent, the heterdimers formed by the products of <i>luxI</i> and <i>luxR</i> will accumulate and activate the luxPR promoter.<br/>

<p>Further, we quantitively showed the antibacterial effect with our favorite compositve part <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3606029" target="_blank">BBa_K3606029</a>, which is RFC21 assembly compatible.<br/>

<p>Similarly, we shown that our antimicrobial peptide suppresses WT bacteria growth (data shown on <a href="/Team:Fudan/Parts#Composite" target="_blank">/Team:Fudan/Parts#Composite</a> and the main page of <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3606029" target="_blank">the part in the Registry</a>).</p>

<p>Both calcium deficiency or high blood calcium leads to many diseases and severely reduces the quality of life. Using our probiotic product to cure osteoporosis might lead to calcium over supplementation. It is important to monitor blood calcium levels while using our calcium supplement.</p>
<p>Traditional blood calcium testing requires at least 5 mL blood and dedicated machines. We developed CaAsst (short from Calcium Assistant) to measure trace calcium ion in the blood, as little as 10 microliters. We use methylthymol blue to convert calcium concentration into 620 nm absorbance (A620). Our experimental results showed a linear relationship between calcium concentration and A620, within 20 mM calcium ion in solution, while the concentration of blood calcium ion is around 2-4 mM.<br/>

<p>In addition, we introduced common interference substances to showcase the robustness of our measurement.<br/>
