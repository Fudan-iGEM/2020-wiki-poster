Poster Guidelines and Rules

New in 2020, teams will create an interactive poster using their assigned poster wiki page. This page will be the only wiki page you can edit after the Wiki Freeze. Below are some guidelines and rules for this new type of poster.

Guidelines

* Posters should be a visual abstract and clear, concise summary of your project.
* Your poster page should not be an endlessly scrolling page, packed with small-font text, etc.
* Posters are not meant to be landing pages to link to more information about your project. A poster is meant to stand alone.
* The use of links is discouraged. Judges will not be clicking on links on your poster page during their evaluation.
* Teams should divide the poster into sections on the page to break up the information into easy-to-read and easy-to-find sections.
* Posters can contain up to three (3) short animated images (5-10 sec in length; gif format preferred) to highlight a specific part of your project. These animated images should be minor elements and be used to help explain complex ideas or results.

Rules

* No videos are allowed on the Team Poster page. Videos were done for the Project Promotion Video and Team Presentation Video, and you can post other videos on your Team Wiki pages.
* All content must be hosted on the iGEM servers.
* All images and files used for the poster must be exclusively uploaded for the poster. If you want to show the same image on one of your Wiki pages and on the Poster, then you need to upload the same image twice.
* You cannot use the same URL for an image or file on your Team Wiki and your Team Poster.
* For uploading images and files for your poster, you must use the following naming convention: T--[TeamName]--Poster_[Section].file extension. These uploaded images and files can only be posted on the poster page.

The expectations for viewing the content will be in a standard web browser on a 13-inch computer screen (1280*800 pixels) set at 100% zoom in the browser.

<p>In Asia, many old people suffer from insufficient calcium intake and related diseases such as osteoporosis. Considering that traditional calcium supplementation is not efficient and user-friendly enough, we intended to develop a kind of engineered bacteria based on <i>E. coli</i> that can colonize in the human intestine and secrete peptides to promote calcium absorption.</p>
<p>We introduced the quorum sensing system to colonize bacteria in the intestine. Once the bacteria have successfully colonized the intestinal tract, the luxPR promoter will be activated and a series of short peptides that can bind to calcium and promote calcium absorption of intestinal epithelial cells will be expressed. A kill switch is added accordingly for safety.</p>
<p>Our project provides a novel delivery method to provide calcium supplements sustainably. And we are actively seeking commercialization possibilities to expand our project impact, to reach more population, for the elderly's good health and well-being.</p>

<p>We linked these peptides through Phe-Arg (FR) junctions.

            <!--Write the text explaining this section -->
            <div class="text">

Based on previous work, We decided to use luxI/luxR and TetR to construct a quorum sensor system with the antimicrobial peptide microcin B17 (MccB17) expression system to achieve the "on" and "off" effects of controlling the growth of engineered bacteria.
McbABCDEFG jointly completes the expression, processing, and secretion of MccB17.
Among them, mcbA expresses the main structure of the antimicrobial peptide, and mcbBCD is responsible for the post-translational modification of the antimicrobial peptide. McbEF expresses the channel protein to secrete the peptide antibiotic. McbG is accountable for the immunity against MccB17. McbEFG is all related to E. coli 's immunity while self-producing microcin.
TldD/tldE is a metalloprotease that is ubiquitous in bacteria. When the surrounding bacteria absorb MccB17 produced by Escherichia coli , TldD/tldE will activate it and kill the bacteria.

In our antimicrobial peptide expressing system, McbABCD is under the control of a constitutive promoter, but PtetR regulates the expression of McbEFG. When the number of engineered bacteria in the intestine is small, few dimers formed cannot activate the luxpR promoter. Thus, TetR and CaAP expression systems are both silent. However, McbEFG is expressed and transports MccB17, which can inhibit the growth of surrounding bacteria.

When the number of bacteria increases to a certain extent, the dimers formed by the products of luxI and luxR will accumulate and activate luxpR. At this time, tetR is turned on, and PtetR is off. As a result, McbEFG stops expressing, and the CaAP system begins to work. Since the population number has reached a certain level, the engineered bacteria can express CaAP more efficiently. Meanwhile, MccB17 is still continuously expressed but cannot be effectively effluxed, which will cause the toxins to gradually accumulate in the engineered bacteria and prevent them from continuously unrestricted proliferation.

To achieve better expression efficiency, we have made an improvement in this system by creating a new promoter fusion. As ptetR has been studied thoroughly and is well-characterized, we created promoter fusion of pl and tetO. Not only is it regulated by tetR and anhydrotetracycline, but it also inherits the expression level of pl. This also allows us to create the desired promoter simpler.


@@@@

To solve the problem, we have proposed some improvement plans. By researching the literature and talking with Professor Lin from the Fudan University Academy of Sciences, we decided to use low-copy plasmids to reduce the expression burden of engineered bacteria. We tried to keep the main part of MccB17 (McbABCD) a relatively low expression and high express the immune part (McbEFG) to achieve high secretion of MccB17.

The highly expressed channel proteins and immune proteins will export more MccB17 and reduce the accumulation of antimicrobial peptides in the engineered bacteria cells, thereby inducing them to produce more antimicrobial peptides.

Traditional blood calcium testing requires at least 5ml blood. We developed a new measurement technique called CaAsst. We use methylthymol blue to convert the measurement of calcium concentration into the measurement of absorbance. Experiment results show a linear relationship between calcium concentration and absorbance within a specific range. We also introduced some interference substances to showcase the stability of our measurement project. CaAsst has more room for development and may be widely adapted for other tests like the blood sugar test.
